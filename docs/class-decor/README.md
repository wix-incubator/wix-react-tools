# Class Decor

The class decor API allows easily and efficiently hooking into any instance method. 
The main use case is to customize react lifecycle methods in class components.

 - [onInstance](./on-instance.md) - register callback to be called on instance creation
 - [middleware](./middleware.md) - add a middleware to a method
 - [before](./before.md) - register a callback to be called before a class method is called
 - [after](./after.md) - register a callback to be called before a class method is called
 - [add](./add.md) - add a method to a class
